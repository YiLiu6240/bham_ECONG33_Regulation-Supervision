\section{Questions One - Six}

Please refer to \citet[Chap.2]{hull2012risk} for the discussions of the activities of banks, the financial statements of banks, and different risks.
You need to know how the various operations of a bank are reflected in the different items of the financial statements, and how gains and losses are reflected as well.

\section{Question Seven}

In order to find the additional capital to hold, we need to find the critical value V in the distribution of income that:

``We will be 99.9\% sure that we will not get an income less than V%
\footnote{
  see \citet[Chap.9, pp.183-185]{hull2012risk} for detailed explanations.}%
.''

Or equivalently,

\begin{align*}
  Pr(X \leq V) & = 1-0.99\% \\
               & = 0.1\%
\end{align*}

where X denotes a random outcome in the distribution of
$ X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) $, $ \mu = 0.6, \sigma = 2 $
and significance level $ \alpha = 0.001 $.

So $ V $ will be the $ 0.1 $th percentile value in the distribution, which is%
\footnote{
  $ Z_{\alpha} = 3.090 $  when  $ \alpha = 0.001 $.
  You need to refer to a statistics book about the transformation between a standardised normal critical value and a normal critical value.
}%
:

\begin{align*}
  V & = \mu - Z_{\alpha}\sigma \\
    & = 0.6 - 3.09*2 \\
    & = -5.58
\end{align*}

Let $ C $ be the additional capital level required, and we have:

\begin{align*}
  5 + C + V \geq 0, \Rightarrow C \geq 0.58
\end{align*}

Therefore regulators will require the bank to hold additional \$0.58 million capital to guarantee that its capital will not be wiped out for 99.9\% of the situation.
