\section*{Concept}

(For detailed discussion of Value-at-Risk please refer to \citet[Chap.9]{hull2012risk}).

What we try to get from Value-at-Risk is to measure the maximum level of losses given a confidence level, or ``how bad can the losses be for p\% of all the possible scenarios''.

Using the scenario we discussed in Class set 1, where the bank's profit follows a normal distribution of \(X \sim N(\mu = 0.6, \sigma^2 = 2^2)\). We try to pinpoint a \(V\) which divides the area of probabilities into two portions \(0.1\%\) and \(99.9\%\).

  \(pdf\) & \(cdf\)
  \end{tabular}

% In other words, we try to pinpoint an \(x\) (or a range of \(x\)) that is associated with the cumulative probability on the \(cdf\).

% The location of \(VaR\) is also dependent on how we denote \(x\). In the above example, we denote \(x\) as ``gains'', and when we denote \(x\) as ``losses'', we get:

% As we have discussed in the class tutorial, \(VaR\) is also applicable when dealing with discrete outcomes.
