\section*{Concept}

(For detailed discussion of Value-at-Risk please refer to
\citet[Chap.9]{hull2012risk}).

What we try to get from Value-at-Risk is to measure the maximum level of losses
given a confidence level, or ``how bad can the losses be for p\% of all the
possible scenarios''.

Using the scenario we discussed in Class set 1, where the bank's profit follows
a normal distribution of \(X \sim N(\mu = 0.6, \sigma^2 = 2^2)\), we try to
pinpoint a \(V\) which divides the area of probabilities (under the probability
density function \(pdf\) curve) into two portions \(0.1\%\) and \(99.9\%\). It's
even easier for us to spot \(V\) that is associated with a cumulative
probability of \(0.001\) on the cumulative distribution function \(cdf\) plot.
The \(V\) is the \(VaR\) we are looking for
(Figure~\ref{fig:note2_VaR_gaussian}).

Under such a normal distribution setting, we calculate \(VaR\) from the
``transformation'' formula\footnote{ which is derived from the normal
  distribution quantile function (inverse function of \(cdf\)):

  \begin{equation*}
    VaR_{1-\alpha} = F^{-1}_{X} (x) = \mu + \sigma \sqrt{2} {erf}^{-1} (2F - 1)
  \end{equation*}
}:
\begin{equation*}
  VaR_{1-\alpha} = \mu + Z_{\alpha} \sigma
\end{equation*}

    \(pdf\) & \(cdf\)
  \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

In addition, note that the \(VaR\) is represented differently if we denote \(x\)
as losses (Figure~\ref{fig:note2_VaR_losses}).

                                                                                \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{output/note2_normal_cdf_losses.pdf} \\
    \(pdf\) & \(cdf\)
  \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

We discussed in the class tutorial how \(VaR\) can be obtained for other kinds
of continuous distributions. We also discussed how \(VaR\) can be applied when
dealing with discrete outcomes. Refer to \citet[p.186]{hull2012risk} for
details.

\section*{Portfolio \(VaR\) \citep[p.192-194, p.195-197]{hull2012risk}}

From portfolio theory we derive the returns and volatility of an investment
portfolio from the elements (weight \(w_i\), return \(R_i\), volatility
\(\sigma_i\), correlation \(\rho_{i, j}\)) of individual investment:
\begin{align*}
  \mu_p & = E(R_p) \\
  R_p & = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i R_i \\
  \sigma_p^2 & = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2 \sigma_i^2
               + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} \rho_{i, j} w_i w_j \sigma_i \sigma_j
\end{align*}

Suppose we still retain the normal distribution assumption for the returns of
individual investment in a portfolio, then we can derive \(VaR_{1-\alpha, p} =
\mu_p + Z_{\alpha} \sigma\) by sustituting the individual elements into the
equation.

The multi-period \(VaR\) can essentially be represented as a portfolio \(VaR\)
where we should take autocorrelation into account.

If we further impose the condition that the individual returns are \(i.i.d\)
then we can derive simpler expression for the portfolio/multi-period \(VaR\).
However this strong condition is generally not held.
