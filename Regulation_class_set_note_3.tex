The intuition of the Basel I Capital Adequacy Requirement is that the regulatory
capital should be at least 8\% of the risk-weighted assets, and at least 50\% of
the regulatory capital should be Tier 1 (Cooke Ratio).
\begin{align*}
  \textit{Tier 1 Capital} \geq 4\% \, \textit{of RWA} \\
  \textit{Tier 1 Capital} + \textit{Tier 2 Capital} \geq 8\% \, \textit{of RWA}
\end{align*}

\section{Risk-Weighted Assets}

\subsection{On-Balance-Sheet Items}

For on-balance-sheet items, we mutiply their asset amounts with their
corresponding risk weights.

\subsection{Off-Balance-Sheet Items}

For off-balance-sheet items, their \textit{credit equivalent amounts} are
considered as their ``asset amounts''.

\begin{itemize}
\item For \textbf{non-derivatives}, the credit equivalent amount is calculated
  by applying a conversion factor to the principal amount of the instrument.
\item For derivatives, the formula for the credit equivalent amount for
  derivative \(j\) is
  \begin{align*}
    C_{j} = max( V_{j}, 0 ) + a_{j} L_{j}
  \end{align*}

  V: current value of the derivative to the bank (a positive V means the bank is exposed to a loss of V, a negative V leaves the bank unaffected) \\
  a: the add-on factor \\
  L: the principal amount \\
\end{itemize}

    \(<\) 1 & 0.0 & 1.0 & 6.0 & 7.0 & 10.0 \\

    \(>\) 5 & 1.5 & 7.5 & 10.0 & 8.0 & 15.0 \\

\subsubsection{Netting}

With netting, the credit equivalent amount(CEA) of the derivatives for a
particular counterparty and the net replacement ratio(NRR) is
\begin{align*}
  CEA & = max(\sum_{i=1}^{N} V_{i}, 0) + (0.4 + 0.6 NRR) \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_{i} L_{i} \\
  NRR & = \frac{ max(\sum_{i=1}^{N} V_{i}, 0) }{  \sum_{i=1}^{N} max(V_{i}, 0) }
\end{align*}

\subsection{Total risk Weighted Assets}

The total risk weighted assets for a bank with N on-balance-sheet items and M
off-balance-sheet items is

\begin{align*}
  \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} L_{i} + \sum_{j=1}^{M} w_{j}^{*} C_{j}
\end{align*}
