  \large Basel II: Capital Regulation for Credit Risk}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

There are three approaches to calculate regulatory capital for credit risk: the standardised approach, the foundational IRB approach, and the advanced IRB approach.

The intuition is to give banks the incentive to develop their own risk management skill to enjoy lower capital from the more sophisticated approach (\textit{why and how?}).

\section{Standardised Approach}

The creditworthiness of the counterparties are now taken into account (in the form of external credit ratings).

The risk weight for retail lending: 75\%; for residential mortgage: 35\%; for commercial real estate: 100\%.

\section{The IRB Approach}

Intuition: The regulatory capital is to cover unexpected loss only. Expected loss is to be covered by the pricing of risks.

\subsection*{Corporate, Sovereign, and Bank Exposures}

The risk-weighted assets are calculated as

\begin{align*}
  RWA & = 12.5 \times EAD \times LGD \times (WCDR - PD) \times MA \\
  \textrm{where} \\
  \rho & = 0.12(1 + e^{-50 \times PD}) \\
  WCDR & = N[\frac{ N^{-1} (PD) +\sqrt{\rho} N^{-1} (0.999) }{ \sqrt{ 1 - \rho } }] \\
  b & = [0.11852 - 0.05478 \times ln(PD)]^{2} \\
  MA & = \frac{ 1 + (M-2.5) \times b }{ 1 - 1.5 \times b }
\end{align*}

$ N(.) $ and $ N-1(.) $ can be calculated using NORM.S.DIST and NORM.S.INV functions in Excel respectively(you can also use a normal distribution table).

\subsection*{Retail Exposures}

For residential mortgages, $ \rho $ is set to 0.15.

For other retail exposures, the risk-weigthed assets are calculated as

\begin{align*}
  RWA & = 12.5 \times EAD \times LGD \times (WCDR - PD) \\
  \textrm{where} \\
  \rho & = 0.03 + 0.13 e^{-35 \times PD}
\end{align*}
