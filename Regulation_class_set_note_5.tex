\section*{Opeartional Risk of Basel II}

Defining operational risk by the Basel Committee: ``...the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events''.

Four categories of causal factors:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Internal processes;
    \item Human resources;
    \item Systems;
    \item External events;
\end{enumerate}

Note: this definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risk.

Examples of Operational Rsik: available in your lecture notes. One of the most famous examples is the collapse of Barings Bank from rogue trading.

Credit risks and market risks are easier to quantify (such as the parameters in IRB approach, or the VaR technique for market risk). It is difficult for a firm to quantify its operational risk.

The basic indicator approach and standardised approach are based on calculating the gross operating income (GOI) of a period. The capital requirement is then calculated by appying a risk factor to the GOI.


\subsection{Basic Indicator Approach}

\begin{align*}
    K_{OR} = \alpha \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{3} Max(0, GOI_{t-i}) }{ N }
\end{align*}

{\footnotesize where N is the number of years, of the last three, in which GOI was positive}

For BIA, the risk factor $ \alpha $ is fixed at 15\%.


\subsection{Standardised Approach}

\begin{align*}
    K_{OR} = \sum_{i=1}^{3} \frac{ Max(\sum_{j=1}^{8} \beta_j {GOI}_{j, t-i}, 0) }{ 3 }
\end{align*}

For standardised approach, the risk factor $ \beta $ varies with 8 business lines

\section*{Stressed $ VaR $($ sVaR $) of Basel 2.5}

Historical simulation: For $ VaR $, the historical period is one to four years; For $ sVaR $, the historical period is 250-day of stressed market conditions (please refer to
 Hull, Chap 14
 for historical simulation approach).

Capital calculation:

\begin{align*}
    Max({VaR}_{t-1}, m_c \times {VaR}_{avg}) + Max({sVaR}_{t-1}, m_s \times {sVaR}_{avg})
\end{align*}

\section*{Capital Requirement of Basel III}
Three levels: T1 capital, T1+T2 capital, ``capital conservation buffer''
\begin{itemize}

    \item T1: 6\% (up from 4\%), of which core T1 4.5\%
    \item T1+T2: 8\%
    \item capital conservation buffer: 2.5\% core T1

\end{itemize}

Minimum of 3\%

\section*{Liquidity of Basel III: Net Stable Funding Ratio}

\begin{align*}
    \frac{ \textit{Amount of stable funding} }{ \textit{Required amount of stable funding} } \geq 100\%
\end{align*}

Each items in the numerator/the denominator is weighted by a risk factor. The available stable funding factor (ASF) for the numerator and the required stable funding (RSF) for the denominator.
